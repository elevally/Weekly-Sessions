    "## Exercise 1: Gaussian Quadrature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical integration is referred to as numerical quadrature because of the procedure of counting boxes (i.e. the trapezoid rule) that involves adding up *quadralaterals*. Newman and other computational physics textbook authors all treating Gaussian quadrature essentially like a black box.  Here is the main idea of the method, as paraphrased from Landau's book **A Survey of Computational Physics**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic integration function, $f(x)$ is redefined in terms of a weighting function $W(x)$.  The following line is exact:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Int = \\int_a^b f(x) dx = \\int_a^b W(x) g(x) dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What might that gain us?  Take a numerical approximation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_a^b W(x) g(x)~ dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i g(x_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of calculating the N weights ($w_i$) and integration points ($x_i$) before performing the integral with a particular goal (or constraint). For instance, in Gaussian quadrature the defined constraint is if $f(x)$ is a $(2N-1)$ polynomial, we make the approximation error vanish.  This can only happen for a particular set of weights ($w_i$) and points ($x_i$).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, an exact case might involve: $f(x)=x(x+1)$, so $W(x)=x$ and $g(x)=x+1$.  Since $f(x)$ is a second order polynomial, than $2N-1=2 \\rightarrow N=3/2$.  So we propose round up to N=2.  What is with the rounding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus Newman states the rule differently: *Gaussian integration on N points gives exact answers for the integrals of polynomial functions up to and including polynomials of degree 2N-1, which means degree 5 when N=3.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Let's test this using Newman's black box he provides in the supplementary material.  Why do I call it a blackbox?  He puts the Legendre Polynomials in an appendix in the back of the book, posts the following code online, and doesn't explain how it works, but calls it in his text examples. *\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note the exceptional docstring that follows most of the conventions - it even has usage examples of how to call the function.**"

    "$$\n",
    "n! = \\biggl\\lbrace\\begin{array}{ll}\n",

    "$$\n",

    "    if n==1:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Note how, if $n$ is not equal to 1, the function calls itself to calculate the factorial of $n-1$.  This is recursion.  If we now say ```print(factorial(5))``` the computer will correctly print the answer $120$."
